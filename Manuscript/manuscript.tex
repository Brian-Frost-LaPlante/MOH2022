\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}
\par{Historically, the in vivo study of cochlear mechanics has been limited to measurements of the basilar membrane (BM). The advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the last decade has allowed for vibrometry at a depth, facilitating the study of intra-organ of Corti complex (OCC) motions. Of particular interest is the motion of the electromotile outer hair cells (OHCs), which play an important role in the amplifying vibration responses and increasing the range of sound-pressure levels (SPLs) over which hearing operates.}
\par{Several groups have presented OCT measurements of OHC motion in the base of the sensitive gerbil cochlea. In some instances, these measurements have differed significantly from one another. In particular, groups have reported disparate phase differences between displacements in the ``OHC region" and at the BM.}
\par{Several aspects complicate these measurements. The first is that the term ``OHC region" is ill-defined; the OHCs are 40 $\mu$m long and 10 $\mu$m wide, and come in rows of three per longitudinal cross-section. Mechanical intuition may lead one to believe that the apical surface of the OHCs, called the reticular lamina (RL), may move differently from the basal surface attached to the Deiters' cells as the OHC compresses and expands due to electromotility. Generally, it is naive to assume that the entire ~120 $\mu$m$^2$ OHC region moves uniformly.}
\par{A second complication is that measurements are taken at an angle with respect to the orientation of the cochlea, unknown \textit{a priori}. This means that (1) displacements measured via OCT are projections of the three-dimensional motion onto an unknown axis, and (2) measured points at the OHC and BM within a single measurement may lie in different longitudinal cross-sections.}
\par{The first of these ambiguities is discussed by Cooper et al (REF), wherein the authors discuss the hypothetical scenario that OHCs exhibit some fluid-like elliptical motions. Their model showed that the phase difference between measured OHC and BM motion relied heavily on the viewing angle, with any deviation between -180 and +180 degrees being achievable. The viewing angle is critical for the assessment of phase differences between OHC and BM motion.}
\par{The second of these ambiguities is discussed by Frost et al (REF), wherein we developed a program which measured the relative anatomical displacements between structures measured via OCT. We used this program to account for the longitudinal displacement between measured OHC and BM, and showed that this correction significantly affected the character of OHC phase re BM. This included a discrepancy of up to 90 degrees between displacement-accounted and single-measurement phases at high frequencies.}
\par{With these complications in mind, it is difficult to interpret presented OCT measurements of OHC displacement reported without a viewing angle. The group of Ren has achieved RL and OHC displacement measurements (via an interferometer similar to OCT) taken at a purely transverse angle, both in gerbil and mouse (REF). They show that RL phase leads BM at low frequencies, but that this lead decreases monotonically and near-linearly until the structures are in phase at about 80\% of the best frequency (BF). After this zero crossing, the RL re BM phase continues its monotonic decrease, with the RL lagging the BM at near- and supra-BF frequencies.}
\par{Meanwhile the other hand, our displacement-accounted data (i.e. OHC and BM in the same tonotopic cross-section) taken at a viewing angle with a significant longitudinal component shows a phase difference of a very different character. We see that OHC leads BM across frequency, including at high frequencies -- where Ren et al see an 80 degree \textit{lag}, we see a 90 degree \textit{lead}.}
\par{We have developed a method to isolate the transverse and longitudinal components of motion of structures within the OCC, wherein we account both for the longitudinal displacement between structures and the projection incurred by the viewing angle. Similar to the work of Lee et al (REF), we do so by taking measurements at multiple viewing angles. Our method requires no \textit{a priori} knowledge of either measurement angle, or of the positions of the structures being measured. We employ a linear approximation of the longitudinal direction at acquisition time, followed by \textit{post hoc} registration of structures measured at several longitudinal locations and viewing angles. We then backproject the measured displacements to achieve a reconstructed longitudinal-transverse profile of a structure's motion.}
\par{We present the method, an analysis of its fidelity with respect to viewing angle, as well as \textit{in vivo} data from the base of the gerbil cochlea in which the longitudinal-transverse motion at the base of several OHCs has been reconstructed. In this sample data set, our reconstructed transverse displacements are consistent with previously measured pure-transverse displacements. We also see that longitudinal OHC displacement is generall smaller than transverse OHC displacement in magnitude, and ~180 degrees out of phase (with respect to our chose coordinate system) with transverse OHC displacements across frequency.}

\section{\label{sec:methods}Methods}

\subsection{\label{sec:acquisition}Acquisition}
\par{The acquisition process follows a few simple steps: (1) prior to acquisition, ensure the BM looks as horizontal as possible in the orienting B-Scan, (2) determine the approximate longitudinal direction and take measurements of a single structure at multiple longitudinal locations, (3) rotate the preparation and try to isolate similar cross-sections with the BM appearing horizontal in the orienting B-Scan, (4) again, find the approximate longitudinal direction and take measurements of the same structure at multiple longitudinal locations.}
\par{Orienting the preparation so that the BM appears horizontal in each cross-section ensures that the radial component of the optic axis is approximately zero. This is important, as we are attempting to simplify our problem to two dimensions – transverse and longitudinal. Failing to account for this radial angle will make our two-dimensional reconstruction impossible.}
\par{Determining the approximate longitudinal directions works via a linear approximation of the cochlea’s anatomical coordinates, similar to the planar approximation employed in Frost et al, 2022. As we only need the longitudinal direction for acquisition, this is a simpler process – we use ThorImage and locate a landmark in some cross-section; for example, we can choose the base of the OHC, or the thickest part of the BM. We record the optical coordinates at these positions, $p_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $p_2 = x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The difference between these points is a linear approximation of a vector in the longitudinal direction, so the unit longitudinal vector is
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:lunit}
		l = \frac{p_2-p_1}{|p_2-p_1|}.
	\end{equation}
}
\par{We can find points of measurement at fixed increments along the longitudinal direction. If we start at a point $q_0$, and want to measure $N$ points over longitudinal distance $L$, we measure at 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:points}
		q_n = q_0 + \frac{nL}{N}l,\;n=0,1,\ldots,N-1.
	\end{equation}
}
\par{We take volume scans after each run so that outside of the time pressure of an experiment, we can apply our more complex orientation program (FROST ET AL REF). In doing so, we can assess the accuracy of our assumption that the radial component of our measurement axis is 0, as well as the direction of the longitudinal vector.}

\subsection{\label{sec:registration}Registration}

\par{As we have made sure to remove the radial component of motion from our measurements, we can assume the optical $z$ axis is comprised of only longitudinal ($l$) and transverse ($t$) components. We write the optical axis’ unit vector as a two-dimensional vector in anatomical
coordinates, $z = (z_l, z_t)$.
}
\par{Eqn. \ref{eqn:lunit} is used in the acquisition step to find the longitudinal vector $l$, which has optical $x$, $y$ and $z$ components. The $z$ component of this vector represents the amount of longitudinal motion that is projected onto the optical axis, $z_l$. To find the $t$ component of $z$, we need only to recall that $z$ is a unit vector, so that $z_l^2 + z_t^2 = 1$. Using the notation from Eqn. \ref{eqn:lunit}, we have

	\begin{align}
		z_l &= \frac{z_2-z_1}{|p_2-p_1|},\\
		z_t &= \sqrt{1-z_l^2}.
	\end{align}
}
\par{Knowing this, we can relate the OHC and BM longitudinal locations within a single measurement. If the structures along a single measurement axis are spaced $\Delta z$ apart, then the OHCs lie $\Delta l = z_l \Delta z$ apical of the BM. The measured BM $\Delta l$ apical of this measurement is thereby in the same longitudinal cross-section as the OHC in the first measurement. We call these BM and OHC measurements \textit{aligned} to one another. At each measurement angle, we compose a list of all aligned OHC and BM measurements.}
\par{To register points to one another between viewing angles, we use the phase of BM motion. By matching the phase responses of BM measurements taken at different viewing angles, we can register the cross-sections in which these BM motions were measured. This operates under the assumption that BM motion is entirely transverse, so that its phase response at each cross-section will be the same at each viewing angle. }
\par{Having registered BM points to one another, we can then consult our list of aligned BM-OHC pairs. The OHCs aligned to registered BM positions are also registered, allowing us to isolate the same OHCs at different viewing angles.}

\subsection{\label{sec:reconstruction}Reconstruction}
\par{Each OCT measurement is a projection of a true 3-D motion onto the optical $z$ axis. In the current context, we have made efforts to eliminate the representation of radial motion in our projection,so that the problem can be framed as the projection of a 2-D longitudinal-transverse \textit{true motion} $d$ onto a 2-D transverse-longitudinal $z$ axis, forming the \textit{projected motion} $\delta$.}
\par{Above we describe the method by which we determine the $z_l$ and $z_t$ components of the optical axis in each experiment. The projection onto this axis is given by the dot product
     \begin{equation}
         \delta = z \cdot d = \begin{pmatrix}z_l& z_t\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}d_l\\d_t\end{pmatrix}.
     \end{equation}
}
\par{At each angle, if we are truly measuring at one position, $d$ will remain the same and $z$ will     change. If we take measurements at two angles, we form the system of equations:
     \begin{equation}\label{projmat}
         \begin{pmatrix}\delta_1 \\ \delta_2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}l_1 & t_1\\l_2 & t_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}d_l\\d_t\end{pmatrix},
     \end{equation}
     where the rows of the matrix are the $z$ axes corresponding to each angle, and $\delta_i$ is the     projection measured at the $i^\text{th}$ angle.
}
\par{We measure $\delta_i$ and determine the $l$ and $t$ components of the $z$ axis as described above. We want to reconstruct $d$, which can be done simply by inverting the matrix in Equation \ref{projmat}. This is possible if and only if the rows of the matrix are linearly independent, i.e. if the measurement axes are not colinear. So long as we measure at two sufficiently distinct (to be quantified shortly) angles, we can reconstruct $d$ by performing the matrix inverse:
     \begin{equation}\label{fullreconstruct}
         \begin{pmatrix}d_l\\d_t\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{l_1 t_2 - l_2 t_1}\begin{pmatrix}t_2&-t_1\\-l_2  & l_1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\delta_1\\ \delta_2\end{pmatrix}.
     \end{equation}
}
\par{Achieving measurements of the same structures at different angles is constrained by the preparation. In practice, a 15 degree rotation is tractable in our preparation, but significantly larger angles are not consistently achievable (yet). Of course, one could attempt to reconstruct from measurements taken at angles with only a fraction of a degree of discrepancy, but intuitively this will be unreliable due to the precision of our devices and the noise in the displacement signal.}
\par{The precision of our reconstruction can be found via the \textit{condition number} $\kappa$ of our projection matrix in Equation \ref{projmat}. The condition number is defined as
     \begin{equation}
         \kappa (A) = \frac{|\sigma_{max}|}{|\sigma_{min}|},
     \end{equation}
where $\sigma_{max}$ and $\sigma_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum singular values of matrix $A$. The condition number of a matrix represents how ``well-posed" a system of equations is, i.e. how close to singular the matrix is. A matrix with a large condition number will amplify noise significantly more than a matrix with a small condition number. The ``rule of thumb" is that noise is multiplied by around $\kappa$. That is, for $\kappa \approx 10^k$, about $k$ digits of precision are lost via the matrix multiplication. Note that a matrix and its inverse have the same condition number.
}
\par{Table \ref{kappas} shows condition numbers for some possible angular deviations. Condition number does not depend on the absolute angle, but only the absolute difference between the two measurement angles. We should note that our usual precision is on the order of $0.1$ nm, and our signal at higher dB SPL is in the range of 1-10 nm.}
 
\begin{table} 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Angular deviation & Condition number $\kappa$ \\
        \hline
        20$^\text{o}$ & 5.67\\
        15$^\text{o}$ & 7.60\\
        10$^\text{o}$ & 11.43\\
        5$^\text{o}$ & 22.90 \\
        1$^\text{o}$ & 114.59\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A table of condition numbers for the projection matrix at possible measurement angular deviations.}
\label{kappas}
\end{center}
\end{table}
 
\par{These should be more-or-less known and kept in mind when analyzing data reconstructed via this method. The realized 15-degree angle will lead to an eight-fold increase in the noise level, which means our results are accurate to about 0.8 nm.}


\section{\label{sec:results}Results}

\par{We have employed the method described above in the base of the gerbil cochlea, with measurements taken through the round window membrane at angles of approximately 45$^\text{o}$ and $60^\text{o}$. We take data at 11 positions spaced 15 $\mu$m apart longitudinally at each angle, ensuring that at each point we measure a position at the base of the OHCs. We stimulate with one-second, 15-frequency multitone stimuli at 80 dB SPL.}
\par{As we step longitudinally along the cochlea, we expect to see the phase response at the BM to vary along with the tonotopic cross-section. This behavior is displayed in Fig. (FIGURE REFERENCE), providing evidence that our acquisition method is truly stepping along the tonotopic axis.}
\par{As for the registration process, Fig. (FIGURE REF) shows matched BM phases taken at two different angles. While we did not know the overlap of the measured regions at each angle \textit{a priori}, we have found this 60 $\mu$m region of longitudinal overlap \textit{post hoc}. As each of these positions is one longitudinal measurement step apart  at their respective angles, this provides evidence that we have correctly taken uniform longitudinal steps at both angles.}
\par{Applying our reconstruction method to the associated aligned OHCs we arrive at the two-dimensional frequency responses presented in Fig. (FIGURE REFERENCE). At all registered OHC base locations, we see that transverse OHC motion is significantly larger than longitudinal OHC motion across the bulk of the frequency range at 80 dB. Reconstructed transverse OHC displacement phase undergoes the linear lead-to-lag transition measured by Ren et al (REF), with zero-crossing near 0.8BF.}
\par{Interestingly, the longitudinal displacement phase leads transverse displacement phase by about 180 degrees. With respect to our coordinate system, this means that towards-BM transverse displacement is in phase with basal-to-apical longitudinal displacement, with their 2-D transverse-longitudinal displacements being shaped approximately linearly.}

\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusion}

\par{We have developed and presented the application of a method via which longitudinal-transverse 2-D intra-OCC displacements can be reconstructed from 1-D OCT measurements, without any \textit{a priori} knowledge of the measurement angles or measurement locations. We have presented the application of this method to reconstructing the motion of the base of OHCs across a 45 $\mu$m longitudinal region of the base of the cochlea. This method can be used to reconstruct the two-dimensional motion of any structure in the OCC of any animal, so long as the measurement angle can be changed by a sufficient amount.}
\par{A 2-D understanding of intra-OCC motions provides significantly more information about the mechanical operations of structures within, including power transfer of OHCs to the BM. Measurements of this type help to resolve discrepancies between groups, contextualize 1-D measurements and serve as a step towards the goal of reconstructing total 3-D intra-OCC displacements.}

\section{\label{sec:level1}First-level heading:\protect\\ The line
break was forced \lowercase{via} \textbackslash\textbackslash}

This sample document demonstrates proper use of REV\TeX~4.1 (and
\LaTeXe) in manuscripts prepared for submission to AIP
conference proceedings. Further information can be found in the documentation included in the distribution or available at
\url{http://authors.aip.org} and in the documentation for
REV\TeX~4.1 itself.

When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always
shown with their required arguments, using normal \TeX{} format. Ithis format, \verb+#1+, \verb+#2+, etc. stand for required
author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in
\verb+\section{#1}+ the \verb+#1+ stands for the title text of the
author's section heading, and in \verb+\title{#1}+ the \verb+#1+
stands for the title text of the paper.

Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using
\textbackslash\textbackslash. A blank input line tells \TeX\ that the
paragraph has ended.

\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}

This file may be formatted in both the \texttt{preprint} (the default) and
\texttt{reprint} styles; the latter format may be used to
mimic final journal output. Either format may be used for submission
purposes. Hence, it is essential that authors check that their manuscripts format acceptably
under \texttt{preprint}. Manuscripts submitted to AIP that do not
format correctly under the \texttt{preprint} option may be delayed in
both the editorial and production processes.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:level3}Third-level heading: Citations and Footnotes}

Citations in text refer to entries in the Bibliography;
they use the commands \verb+\cite{#1}+ or \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+.
Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly,
its entire repertoire of commands are available in your document;
see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details.
The argument of \verb+\cite+ is a comma-separated list of \emph{keys};
a key may consist of letters and numerals.

By default, citations are numerical; \cite{feyn54} author-year citations are an option.
To give a textual citation, use \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: (Refs.~\onlinecite{witten2001,epr,Bire82}).
REV\TeX\ ``collapses'' lists of consecutive numerical citations when appropriate.
REV\TeX\ provides the ability to properly punctuate textual citations in author-year style;
this facility works correctly with numerical citations only with \texttt{natbib}'s compress option turned off.
To illustrate, we cite several together \cite{feyn54,witten2001,epr,Berman1983},
and once again (Refs.~\onlinecite{epr,feyn54,Bire82,Berman1983}).
Note that, when numerical citations are used, the references were sorted into the same order they appear in the bibliography.

A reference within the bibliography is specified with a \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ command,
where the argument is the citation key mentioned above.
\verb+\bibitem{#1}+ commands may be crafted by hand or, preferably,
generated by using Bib\TeX.
The AIP styles for REV\TeX~4 include Bib\TeX\ style files
\verb+aipnum.bst+ and \verb+aipauth.bst+, appropriate for
numbered and author-year bibliographies,
respectively.
REV\TeX~4 will automatically choose the style appropriate for
the document's selected class options: the default is numerical, and
you obtain the author-year style by specifying a class option of \verb+author-year+.

This sample file demonstrates a simple use of the Bib\TeX\ tool
via a \verb+\bibliography+ command referencing the \verb+aipsamp.bib+ file.
Running Bib\TeX\ (in this case \texttt{bibtex
aipsamp}) after the first pass of \LaTeX\ produces the file
\verb+aipsamp.bbl+ which contains the automatically formatted
\verb+\bibitem+ commands (including extra markup information via
\verb+\bibinfo+ commands). If not using Bib\TeX, the
\verb+thebibiliography+ environment should be used instead.

\paragraph{Fourth-level heading is run in.}%
Footnotes are produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command.
Numerical style citations put footnotes into the
bibliography\footnote{Automatically placing footnotes into the bibliography requires using BibTeX to compile the bibliography.}.
Author-year and numerical author-year citation styles (each for its own reason) cannot use this method.
Note: due to the method used to place footnotes in the bibliography, \emph{you
must re-run BibTeX every time you change any of your document's
footnotes}.

\section{Math and Equations}
Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
\verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
\verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

Below we have numbered single-line equations, the most common kind:
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
|{\bf p}|+p_z\\
px+ip_y
\end{array}\right)\;,
\\
\left\{%
 \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}%
\label{eq:one}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

Not all numbered equations will fit within the text width this
way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
on the same line with a one-line equation:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}\left(1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789\right).
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
\[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]

\subsection{Multiline equations}

Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
to avoid assigning a number:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
\delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
  \sum_{\text{perm}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
using a Roman font within a math environment.

To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
\verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
 \left(
  \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
 \right)
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
\end{eqnarray*}
To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
(\ref{eq:mynum}),
\begin{equation}
g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{5.1$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
\end{equation}

A few notes on \verb=\tag{#1}=. \verb+\tag{#1}+ requires
\texttt{amsmath}. The \verb+\tag{#1}+ must come before the
\verb+\label{#1}+, if any. The numbering set with \verb+\tag{#1}+ is
\textit{transparent} to the automatic numbering in REV\TeX{};
therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, and it must be
manually adjusted if other equations are added. \verb+\tag{#1}+ works
with both single-line and multiline equations. \verb+\tag{#1}+ should
only be used in exceptional case - do not use it to number all
equations in a paper.

Enclosing single-line and multiline equations in
\verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
a set of equations that are ``numbered'' with letters, as shown in
Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:whole}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
\right\},\label{subeq:1}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Putting a \verb+\label{#1}+ command right after the
\verb+\begin{subequations}+, allows one to
reference all the equations in a subequations environment. For
example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

\section{Cross-referencing}
REV\TeX{} will automatically number sections, equations, figure
captions, and tables. In order to reference them in text, use the
\verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands. To reference a
particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear in a section heading, within an
equation, or in a table or figure caption. The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command
is used in the text where the citation is to be displayed.  Some
examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1},
Table~\ref{tab:table1},%

\section{Figures and Tables}
Figures and tables are typically ``floats''; \LaTeX\ determines their
final position via placement rules.
\LaTeX\ isn't always successful in automatically placing floats where you wish them.

Figures are marked up with the \texttt{figure} environment, the content of which
imports the image (\verb+\includegraphics+) followed by the figure caption (\verb+\caption+).
The argument of the latter command should itself contain a \verb+\label+ command if you
wish to refer to your figure with \verb+\ref+.

Import your image using either the \texttt{graphics} or
\texttt{graphicx} packages. Both of these packages define the
\verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command, but they differ in the optional
arguments for specifying the orientation, scaling, and translation of the figure.
Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{fig_1}% Here is how to import EPS art
\caption{\label{fig:epsart} A figure caption. The figure captions are
automatically numbered.}
\end{figure}
is an example of this.

The analog of the \texttt{figure} environment is \texttt{table}, which uses
the same \verb+\caption+ command.
However, you should type your caption command first within the \texttt{table},
instead of last as you did for \texttt{figure}.

The heart of any table is the \texttt{tabular} environment,
which represents the table content as a (vertical) sequence of table rows,
each containing a (horizontal) sequence of table cells.
Cells are separated by the \verb+&+ character;
the row terminates with \verb+\\+.
The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
specifies how data are displayed in each of the columns.
For instance, a column
may be centered (\verb+c+), left-justified (\verb+l+), right-justified (\verb+r+),
or aligned on a decimal point (\verb+d+).
(Table~\ref{tab:table4}%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table4}Numbers in columns Three--Five have been
aligned by using the ``d'' column specifier (requires the
\texttt{dcolumn} package).
Non-numeric entries (those entries without
a ``.'') in a ``d'' column are aligned on the decimal point.
Use the
``D'' specifier for more complex layouts. }
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccddd}
One&Two&\mbox{Three}&\mbox{Four}&\mbox{Five}\\
\hline
one&two&\mbox{three}&\mbox{four}&\mbox{five}\\
He&2& 2.77234 & 45672. & 0.69 \\
C\footnote{Some tables require footnotes.}
  &C\footnote{Some tables need more than one footnote.}
  & 12537.64 & 37.66345 & 86.37 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}
illustrates the use of decimal column alignment.)

Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, although
REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
table.
Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
command.
The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
bottom of a table can be achieved by enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment.
Rows whose columns span multiple columns can be typeset using \LaTeX's
\verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command
(for example, see the first row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table3}This table demonstrates the use of
\textbackslash\texttt{multicolumn} in rows with entries that span
more than one column.}
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 &\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^1$}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^5$}\\
 Ion&1st alternative&2nd alternative&lst alternative
&2nd alternative\\ \hline
 K&$(2e)+(2f)$&$(4i)$ &$(2c)+(2d)$&$(4f)$ \\
 Mn&$(2g)$\footnote{The $z$ parameter of these positions is $z\sim\frac{1}{4}$.}
 &$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(4e)$&$(2a)+(2b)$\\
 Cl&$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(2g)$\footnote{This is a footnote in a table. It is supposed to set on the full width of the page, just as the caption does. }
 &$(4e)^{\text{a}}$\\
 He&$(8r)^{\text{a}}$&$(4j)^{\text{a}}$&$(4g)^{\text{a}}$\\
 Ag& &$(4k)^{\text{a}}$& &$(4h)^{\text{a}}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

The tables in this document illustrate various effects.
Lengthy tables may need to break across pages.
A simple way to allow this is to specify
the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} environment.
Alternatively, using the standard \LaTeXe\ package \texttt{longtable}
gives more control over how tables break and allows headers and footers
to be specified for each page of the table.
An example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
distribution.

There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
the bottom of the page or in the bibliography).
The easiest
and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
lowercase roman letters.
However, it is sometimes necessary to have
multiple entries in the table share the same footnote.
In this case,
create the footnotes using
\verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
\texttt{\#1} is a numeric value.
Each time the same value for \texttt{\#1} is used,
the same mark is produced in the table.
The \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
environment.
Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and
\ref{tab:table2}%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table2}A table with more columns still fits
properly in a column. Note that several entries share the same
footnote. Inspect the \LaTeX\ input for this table to see

Sometimes it can be convenient to place multiple narrow figures or tables side-by-side to conserve space and meet any page length requirements for your conference. This can be done using \texttt{minipage} environments within the \texttt{table} or \texttt{figure} environment. Check the \LaTeX\ source and output for Tables~\ref{tab:multiples1}, \ref{tab:multiples2}, and \ref{tab:multiples3}
\begin{table}[tbp]
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
    \caption{First narrow table.}
    \label{tab:multiples1}
    \begin{ruledtabular}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        Element Symbol & Element Name \\
        \hline
        H & Hydrogen \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{ruledtabular}
\end{minipage}\hfill%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
    \caption{Second narrow table, set alongside.}
    \label{tab:multiples2}
    \begin{ruledtabular}
    \begin{tabular}{lr}
        Trial & Time (s) \\
        \hline
        1 & 2.42 \\
        2 & 2.46 \\
        3 & 2.41 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{ruledtabular}
\end{minipage}\hfill%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
    \caption{Third narrow table, set alongside once again.}
    \label{tab:multiples3}
    \begin{ruledtabular}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        Case & Result \\
        \hline
        A & Pass \\
        B & Fail \\
        C & Pass \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{ruledtabular}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}
for an example of how to do this. The vertical alignment of the \texttt{minipage}s can be adjusted by changing the optional argument to the environment.

All AIP journals require that the initial citation of
figures or tables be in numerical order.
\LaTeX's automatic numbering of floats is your friend here:
just put each \texttt{figure} environment immediately following
its first reference (\verb+\ref+), as we have done in this example file.
